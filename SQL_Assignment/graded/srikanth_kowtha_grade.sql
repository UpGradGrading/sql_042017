 performed all the steps  for all the files shared 


Task 1:
We  have five tables after TASK 0  ,OF which four are DIMENSION tables and ifth  is a fact TABLE
WHERE  DIMENSION TABLE refers TO the ANY OBJECT which keeps changing OVER a PERIOD OF TIME.
&&
 Fact tables are desinged IN a way TO caluclate the fact VALUES FROM the DIMENSION tables.

Thus TO maintain connectivity BETWEEN The Fact TABLE AND DIMENSION tables ,
we need TO have Refrential Integrity {PRIMARY KEY-FOREIGN KEY  relationship} BETWEEN FACT AND 
DIMENSION tables.
Nothing but to have all the primary keys of dimension tables to set as  foreign keys in FACT table.

So that the FACT TABLE will act AS Bridge TABLE AND  provide us required aggreagte and  summaries
 by doing necessary joins



DIMENSION tables :  cust_dimen , Orders_dimen,prod_dimen,shipping_dimen
Fact TABLE : Market_fact



cust_dimen : 
PRIMARY KEY : Cust_id

prod_dimen  : 
primanry KEY : Prod_id

market_fact:
PRIMARY KEY :   (Cust_id,Ord_id,Prod_id,ship_id)  
FOREIGN KEY : (Cust_id ON cust_dimen TABLE  ,Ord_id ON orders_dimen TABLE ,Prod_id ON prod_dimen TABLE,ship_id ON shipping_dimen TABLE)



Imagine a CASE WHERE there is  a shippement regeistered IN shipping_dimen
WITH NO corresponding ORDER IN order_dimen, which IS NOT correct.

Thus there  should be refrential integrity CHECK  BETWEEN orders DIMENSION AND shipping DIMENSION.
so that ONLY orders that were present IN orders_dimen will be IN shipping dimen TABLE.

So ,IF we want TO CREATE a FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT BETWEEN the two tables, 
the child TABLE would have TO have ALL the COLUMNS that comprise the PRIMARY KEY CONSTRAINT 
ON the PARENT TABLE

TO achieve this  we need TO have composite KEY ON {ord_id AND order_id} IN order_dimen TABLE.
also we need TO ADD ord_id COLUMN IN child TABLE shipping_dimen.
now the composite KEY FOR TABLE shipping_dimen will be {ship_id AND order_id}

orders_dimen:
PRIMARY KEY : {ord_id AND order_id}

shipping_dimen:
COLUMNS IN shipping_dimen: Order_id,Ship_Mode,Ship_Date,Ship_id,ord_id
PRIMARY KEY : {ship_id AND order_id}
FOREIGN KEY :  {order_id ON orders_dimen}
